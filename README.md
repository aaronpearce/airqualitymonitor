#  AirQualityMonitor

This is an app that uses HomeKit to display a menu bar item with your current air quality from compatible devices (like an Eve Room). Requires macOS 11.

It showcases some advanced techniques like loading an embedded AppKit framework in a Swift-based Catalyst app, swizzling the main window to not display, setting LSUIElement to hide the app icon in the dock, and presenting a status menu item.
